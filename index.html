    <p>Hello! I am Brendan. This is my second semester here at BYU-I and I am loving it so far.
        I am from Newnan, Georgia, where I have lived for my entire life until coming up here.
        I am majoring in CIT as I have always had a deep love for computers ever since I was little.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy playing games on my PC in my free time as well as listening to various kinds of music.
        I think I might use my knowledge from this course if I ever need to make a website, but don't want to pay for
        hosting.
    </p>
